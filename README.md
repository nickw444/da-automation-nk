## 📋 Overview

This project explores modern TypeScript-based home automation using the [Digital Alchemy](https://github.com/Digital-Alchemy-TS/core) framework. It provides a strongly-typed, service-oriented approach to Home Assistant integration and automation development.

## 🚀 Features

### Current Implementations

- **☀️ Daytime Load Management**: Intelligent solar energy usage optimization
  - Monitors PV production and grid consumption
  - Dynamically manages device loads based on available solar power
  - Prioritized device control system

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Home Assistant instance with entities configured
- Digital Alchemy type mappings generated

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development with hot reload
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test
```

## 🎯 Goals & Experiments

This repository serves as a testing ground for:

- **🔬 Modern TypeScript patterns** in home automation
- **📊 Advanced energy management** algorithms
- **🤖 AI-written automation** experiments
